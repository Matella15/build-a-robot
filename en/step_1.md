## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn about CSS positioning by building their own robot.

## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Build a Robot' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-robot](http://jumpto.cc/web-robot)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Build a Robot' Finished -- trinket.io/html/00736c0e18](https://trinket.io/html/00736c0e18)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ template/index.html
+ template/style.css
+ robot/index.html
+ robot/style.css
+ Lots of .png images

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ robot-finished/index.html
+ robot-finished/style.css
+ robot-finished/Lots of .png images

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ HTML id attribute;
+ Writing CSS:
	+ `#` id selector;
	+ position;
	+ top;
	+ left.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator).

## Challenges
+ "Design your own robot" - applying CSS positioning to create a robot;
+ "Add your own images" - adding more images, with an HTML id attribute and associated CSS.

## Completing this project offline
If children are completing this project offline, they’ll need to save images they intend to use in the same folder as their `Robot.html` file.

They can then just add the name of the file in their `<img>` tags:

```
<img id="hat" src="hat.png" />
```
